# Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights and recommendations for improving budget performance and identifying cost-saving opportunities.My goal is to track revenue, expenses, and profits across different product categories and regions using this dataset.The insights derived from my analysis will inform decision-making and strategic planning for future budgeting.

### Data Sources
Sales Data:The primary data used for this analysis is the "adventure_works_sales.xlsx" file provided by microsoft.This dataset contains information on sales, expenses, and profits across different product categories and regions.

### Tools 
- Excel
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Analysis
  - Data Visualization

 ### Data Cleaning
 In the initial data preparation phase,I performed the following tasks:
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Converting data into a table
  3. Removing duplicate values
  4. Checking data types
  5. Added filters
  6. Filled missed categorical values with "Unknown" on "None"
  7. Calculated missing numerical values with the available data e.g If the missing value was in the revenue column, I would subtract discount from the gross sales to get the revenue.If the 
     values could not be calculated,I had to delete the entire row.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Compare revenue,expenses and profit across different countries and product categories.
 - Determine which segment contributes the most to overall revenue and profit.
 - Evaluate the impact of discounts on profitability.
 - Check sales trends month-over-month.

### Insights and Recommendations for Improving Budget Performance & Cost-Saving Opportunities
#### 1. Revenue,Expenses and Profit Analysis
##### Insight:
Total revenue ($118.67M) is significantly higher than total expenses ($101.81M), leading to a profit of $16.87M. However, expenses are quite high (almost 86% of revenue).
##### Recommendations:
Focus on reducing operational and production costs to improve the profit margin. Analyzing high-cost segments and negotiating better supplier deals could help.
#### 2. Performance by Products
##### Insight:
The product Paseo has the highest revenue.VTT, Amarilla, and Velo are performing moderately.Carretera and Montana are generating lower revenue.
##### Recommendations:
Focus on High-Profit Products (Paseo, Amarilla, VTT)
  - ✅ Increase marketing spend on these products to drive sales.
  - ✅ Adjust pricing strategies (value-based or dynamic pricing).
  - ✅ Offer premium variants of successful products.
Revamp or Discontinue Low-Profit Products (Carretera, Montana, Velo)
  - ✅ Conduct cost analysis—reduce production or sourcing costs.
  - ✅ Bundle these with high-selling items to increase turnover.
  - ✅ Consider phasing out underperforming products.

#### 3. Regional Sales Performance
##### Insight:
Canada and the USA generate the highest revenue while France and Germany have lower profits despite moderate revenue.
##### Recommendations:
 - Optimize operations such as logistics and marketing in France and Germany to reduce costs and increase profitability.
 - Expand sales efforts in Canada and the USA as they show high revenue potential.
 - Conduct a market analysis in Mexico to determine whether expenses can be reduced to improve margins.

#### 4. Segment Performance
##### Insight:
 Government and small business segments generate the highest revenue, while Channel Partners and Midmarket segments contribute the least.
##### Recommendations:
- Explore growth opportunities in the Government and Small Business segments, as they appear to be the most profitable.
- Improve pricing strategies or offer targeted discounts for midmarket and channel partners to increase profitability.
#### 5. Impact of Discounts on Profitability
##### Insight:
A significant portion of discounts fall into the "Medium" and "High" impact categories, suggesting that heavy discounting is reducing profit margins.
##### Recommendations:
- Implement targeted discount strategies instead of broad discounts.
- Focus on value-based pricing and promotions for specific high-margin products.

#### 6. Seasonal Sales Trends
##### Insight:
Sales peak in October and November, while the lowest sales occur in the early months of the year (January – March).
##### Recommendations:
- Increase advertising spend and promotions in slower months to drive sales.
- Optimize inventory levels based on seasonal demand to reduce storage costs.

### Limitations
I had to remove all the missing values that could not be calculated to avoid affecting the accuracy of my work.
